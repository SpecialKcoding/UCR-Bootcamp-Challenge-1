The original document was functional, but there was much room for improvement. There were individual ID and class tags for elements that had the same specifications in CSS, so I identified which ones they were and grouped them together in a much more condensed css stylesheet. In addition, the previous code had the style sheet out of order in accordance with the elements on the HTML sheet, so I moved around my CSS coding to follow a more logical order, which followed the descending elements in HTML as you scroll down the page. A big part of this assignment was also to make it have better accessibility standards, so I added ‘alt’ tags with a description so people will be able to better understand what the images are when using a screen reader. In addition, I also added a title, which can be seen on the website’s tab and I added in more semantic HTML elements like header, nav, section, and footer. I had to be very careful not to get lost in the changes I made, but, after refreshing the page over and over, the website still functions as it did before, but with much cleaner css and more accessible HTML.
